Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Approach:
First connect to the bandit1 server using ssh,

venom@venom:~$ ssh -p 2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

after this it will ask for the password, paste the flag(password) that we got from bandit0.

So now we are connected to the bandit1 server using SSH.

now as said in the challenge the password is in the file who's name is -, here if we try to cat the contents directly cat -, it will not run.

so we use ./ before -, dot and forward slash are like the esacpe sequnce charaters 

bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-

next line of random character is the password for the next level bandit2 :)
